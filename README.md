# nonSNES
An Open-Source HardWare (OSHW) recreation of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (PAL)

The design tries to be a 1:1 recreation of the original SNSP-CPU-01 Rev5 board.

Changes and improvements will be on other branches of this repo, some of the planned ones:
- RGB bypass mod included
- Removing the CIC/swapping it for a CIC replacement
- Region switch
- Replacing the audio DAC
- Replacements for the WRAM and audio RAM
- Replacement for the S-CLK clock generator

## Roadmap for now:
Unfortunately it turned out that the broken board SNES I was trying to revive with this had a broken S-CLK as well.
I'm currently looking for a replacement from a donor SNES but even those are expensive on eBay.
Eventually I want to get the S-CLK and WRAM decapped as no one seems to have done that yet.
